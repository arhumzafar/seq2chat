<br>

*files:*

Datasets that I used can be found here: <br>

1) https://www.kaggle.com/watts2/glove6b50dtxt <br>
2) https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html <br>

<br>

`chatbot.ipynb` -- Notebook that you need to run through the get the model built and saved. *The model is saved in a h5 format*.
<br>

`chat2seq.py` -- Run this file to get the chatbot up and running once the model is saved.

<br>
<br>

*How to run:*

- It can help if you use a GPU to run the model (.ipynb file) for the first time. You can also use Colab or Kaggle.
- Run `chat2seq.py`
